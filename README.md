# Flooring_Company
The goal of my project is to create an application that can read and write flooring orders for Wiley Edge Corp.
The project includes the following:
1) N-tier/MVC architecture, including the use of a service layer 
2) Interfaces 
3) Spring dependency Injection 
4) Unit Testing

I have started by planning out the project using : a flowchart and class diagrams.

I have built the application following the Agile approach.
